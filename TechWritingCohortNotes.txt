Send it to UGCapstoneIT@WGU.edu, use subject line "Cohort"

Use the template from the fileshare (download.zip on laptop, will be moved later)

Assessment code C769? NO, DDT1 for C435

Capstone Process:
Single process with 3 phases:
1. Proposal (Tech Writing) 20 hours
2. Project (Implementing what you've proposed)
3. Project Report (Capstone)

=======================
Developing a Topic:
Make sure it is something interesting
have some or most of the skills needed to implement the project
can identify specific project deliverables
aligns with emphasis and is "doable" in the time frame.

Topic:
mobile game with server reporting
-deliverables: server with logging, android game

use the project scope template (good time saver)

Critical concern:
project scope has to be large enough to encounter problems while executing
cannot pass capstone report assessment if you pick too small of a project even though you can pass the 
tech writing assessment

To Execute or Not?
-Can propose, execute, and write about the project, but is a problem because of the time frame
-Can choose a project that has been recently been completed, not an option for me
-Some people can choose a project that's complete hypothetical
	-most difficult method and not recommended

Waiver is required for everyone
-Contains proprietary content or not (try and avoid proprietary)
	-Fuzz all proprietary details
	-genericize the facts (ABC Corp)

Topic ideas:
-Software: Create/build website or design/implement a mobile application

Technical Writing:
Intro/Summary:
Provide a summary of proposed Tech projct
Need: organization, the problem, my role in solving the problem, the overview 
of the solution, and statement of the proposal
-inclue brief overall of all major sections in the th proposal
-have a high level overview
-Explicit purpose of project-Last sentence to explain that this is a proposal 
to analyze, design and implement X, y , z
Suggested Length: 2-3 pages (double spaced, 12pt font)

========================

Project Summary/Introduction:
"What are you working on these days" - keep it high level with 
little specific detail

Project Rationale:


JIRA/Sharepoint project would be good candidate
-Problems encountered: incomplete documentation of maven repository requirements lost several hours 
						unfamiliarity with use of maven
